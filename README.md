# Hi there 

Hi, I'm **Navika Maglani**!  
**AI/ML Engineer | Data Scientist | NLP & Deep Learning Enthusiast**

I’m a Master’s student in **Data Science** with hands-on experience in:

- Machine learning & deep learning  
- Cloud-based ML pipelines  
- NLP and LLM systems  
- Computer vision  
- Data engineering with PySpark  

I enjoy building **scalable ML pipelines**, **vision models**, and **LLM-powered applications** that solve real-world problems.

I build **end-to-end systems** —  from **data ingestion → model training → evaluation → deployment**.
